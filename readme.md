## Technologies Used
- Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data efficiently.
- Git: A version control system for tracking changes in the project.
- Mongoose: An ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for MongoDB.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A secure method for transmitting information between parties.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to help you organize, catalog, and review books. It provides a structured system for:

- Managing users: Registering and authenticating users securely.
- Cataloging books: Adding, updating, and retrieving book details.
- Reviewing books: Allowing users to leave reviews and ratings.

## Models
The project utilizes the following data models:

1. **User**: Manages user data, including registration and login.
2. **Book**: Handles book details, such as title, author, genre, and more.
3. **Review**: Manages user reviews for specific books.

## API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available for interacting with the system:

### User APIs
- **POST /register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /login**: Authenticate a user by logging in.

### Books API
- **POST /books**: Add a new book to the database.
- **GET /books**: Retrieve a list of all books.
- **GET /books/:bookId**: Get detailed information about a specific book.
- **PUT /books/:bookId**: Update book details.
- **DELETE /books/:bookId**: Delete a book from the system.

### Review APIs
- **POST /books/:bookId/review**: Add a review for a specific book.
- **PUT /books/:bookId/review/:reviewId**: Update a review for a book.
- **DELETE /books/:bookId/review/:reviewId**: Delete a review for a book.

## Authentication and Authorization
Security is paramount, and this project implements authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data and actions. Users can securely register and log in, and protected routes are available for authorized actions.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure your environment variables for MongoDB and JWT.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.
